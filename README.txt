# Birthday Surprise Web App (V2)

Changes requested:
- Confetti (paper strips) limited to 50–90 live particles.
- Balloons limited to 10–20 live balloons.
- Pure CSS Cake with '19' number candles — click to CUT (layers split), then party starts (confetti, balloons, carousel).
- Carousel slideshow: center highlighted, neighbors slightly behind, right-to-left stepping with ~1s pause each step.
- Letter box as CSS envelope (no image).

How to customize:
- Replace images in /assets: photo.jpg, pic1.jpg, pic2.jpg, pic3.jpg
- Edit captions directly in index.html.
- Music uses absolute link (incompetech). Replace the <audio> src if you want your own track.
